# LINGUIS-110 Introduction to Phonetics and Phonology
**Instructor: Susan Lin**

**Developers: Sierra Balatan, Shubham Gupta, Tian Qin, Angelica Rojas, Ronald Walker**

Two labs where students analyze data that they collected on themselves and has been compiled for the whole class. In the first lab, students explore closure and voice-onset time, as well as look at the effect of native language spoken and height on those numbers.

In the second lab, students analyze vowel formants, and compare their vowel space to the rest of the class, as well as investigate the effect of individual metadata on those characteristics. They touch a little on prediction at the end of the notebook.
